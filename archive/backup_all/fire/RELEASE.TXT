                               DRAFT - PRELIMINARY                        Release notes for Actor version 1.1                                    3/5/98                                   R. Gritzo   Note:  This only covers the parts of the actor that have changed significantly   in this release.  I will eventually finish the rest of the documentation. No,   really I will.  Trust me.  ;).   Overview:Version 1.1 is a fairly major upgrade to the actor functionality.In particular, the actor now supports limited mathematical operations as part of theset command.  In addition, the set command now supports setting a variable toanother variable.  The actor now also performs hostname and service name lookupfor all network addresses and port numbers.  In a help for actor management, theactor now creates a pid file containing the pid number of the running actor.   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   NOTE:   The process of looking up host names and service numbers is    inherently VERY time consuming.  This should only be used on a   regular basis for the logic and input specifications, and only   if the resultant delay in starting the actor is acceptable.   Using the name and service as part of normal output commands   should be avoided unless used as part of development.   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Logic device driver specification:In previous versions of the actor explicit specification of the logic device driverhost name and port number was mandantory.  Starting with this release if the logicddhost and port number are not specified in the command line (with the -h <name> -p<number> options) then the logicdd will be assumed to be running on localhost, and theport number will attempt to be obtained from the /etc/services file.  Notspecifying the logicdd port number by command line option AND not having thelogicdd service entry is considered to be a fatal error, and the actor willterminate.  Either the host name or IP address may be specified.  If the host nameis specified, then a lookup capability must exist (named or /etc/hosts) or thehostname will default to localhost.Either the port number or service name may be specified.  If the service name isspecified, then the service must be listed in /etc/services, or a fatal error willresult.The following command lines illustrate these options for logicdd:   actor1 -d1 -n eve -h 192.168.2.1 -p 9900   # normal ip addr port number    actor1 -d1 -n eve -h david -p logicdd   # logicdd on host david, service logicdd   actor1 -d1 -n eve    # logicdd on localhost, service logicdd      Input device driver specification:Starting with this release of the actor the input device may be specified as a hostname (as opposed to an IP address) and a service name (as opposed to a port number).Unlike the logicdd lookup, no default host name is assumed.  Not specifying the input device driver host name or number and service name or port number is considered to be a fatal error, and the actor will terminate.  Either the host name or IP address may be specified.  If the host nameis specified, then a lookup capability must exist (named or /etc/hosts) or thehostname will default to localhost.Either the port number or service name may be specified.  If the service name isspecified, then the service must be listed in /etc/services, or a fatal error willresult.The following lines from the input section illustrate these options:   david.vasulka.org mididd midi #midi actor, host david, device mididd   192.168.2.1 9800 midi #midi actor, ip addr for host david, port 9800   Output command device driver specification:Starting with this release of the actor the output device may be specified as a hostname (as opposed to an IP address) and a service name (as opposed to a port number).Again, Unlike the logicdd lookup, no default host name is assumed.  Not specifying the input device driver host name or number and service name or port number is considered to be a fatal error, and the actor will terminate.  Either the host name or IP address may be specified.  If the host nameis specified, then a lookup capability must exist (named or /etc/hosts) or thehostname will default to localhost.Either the port number or service name may be specified.  If the service name isspecified, then the service must be listed in /etc/services, or a fatal error willresult.The following lines from the output command section illustrate these options:   if %tvar -gt 1      david mididd :90 40 41  #output to mididd running on host david   192.168.2.1 9900 :90 40 40 #output to port 9900 running on host david   Actor CommandsStarting with version 1.1 the actor supports limited mathematical expressions inthe variable set command.  This is the only place this feature is supported (it isnot supported in the if statements, for instance).  In general the set command isstructured like:  set <variable> <value>, which sets the variable to the specifiedvalue.  <variable>:  In this case, the variable name does not need to be prefixed by the %indicator.  This is beceause the code knows that this is a variable value.  Theinternal variables (like midinote value) should not be used here.  This variablename is what is used as the index into logicdd's database, so care should be usedto consider that all actors using the same logicdd have access to this variable.<value>:  This element can range from a simple numeric value to a variableexpression.  It is evaluated (using logicdd if necessary) then used as the datapassed to the logicdd for storage in the database.  Presently only the followingoperations are allowed: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication) and /(division).  The following examples serve to illustrate the options:set var1 3  - Sets the variable named var1 to the numeric value three.set var1 three - Sets the variable named var1 to the string value 'three'.  This   requires that the if test use the proper operator for the type of variable.set var1 %var1+1 - Adds one to the current value of var1, and makes the result the   new value of var1.  Note that var1 must carry it's % designator in the value   section, and that no whitespaces are allowed.  White spaces are not permitted in   the expression, and will cause errors.set var1 %var1/%var2 - Divides var1 by var2, making the result the new value of   var1. Any normal variable or internal variable may be used.   NOTE:  All math is performed as simple short integers, able to range invalue from approximately -32,000 to +32,000.  Some scaling may be required toobtain sufficient resolution.  For example, dividing 5 by 2 gives 2, and dividing 2by 3 gives 0.PID file generation:Also starting with version 1.1, the actor generates a pid file.  This file is inthe standard directory /var/run, and is named actor.<actorname>.pid, where the<actorname> is from the -n argument.  The only content of this file is the PIDnumber of the actor from the getpid() call. This will allow automated scripts to kill actors by being able to easily reference thier PIDs.Reference:The following internal variables are known to the actor:%mnote is the incoming midi note value in decimal.%mchan is the incoming midi command channel number (0 based) in decimal%mstat is the incoming midi status command (equivilant to the upper 4 bits of the   midi status command), but in decimal.%mvel is the velocity value of the incoming midi note, in decimal.%life is the life value of the actor.
