Russ,We are having problems with the plotter and serialdd. Here is the text from thefile I am sending plus logs of hpcp and serialdd. It seems that hpcp sends the characters properly but serialdd does not accept the first character. A very serious problem is that serialdd dies after sending all the characters. I will send thisto Randy as well. Could you contact him to see is he knows what is happening. THIS IS ASHOWSTOPPER FOR SCRIBE.file name "ocrd001.txt"Can you read my lips.If so what am I saying.Good luck.^^^^scribe:~$ hpcp -d2 -t "\r" -h 10.5.1.14 -p 9902 -f ocrd001.txtVerbose: 2 nl->\rHost is 10.5.1.14 Port is 9902 Copying file ocrd001.txt Connecting to host 10.5.1.14, port 9902char H (48)char e (65)char l (6c)char l (6c)char o (6f)char \ (5c)char r (72)char  (a)char C (43)char a (61)char n (6e)char   (20)char y (79)char o (6f)char u (75)char   (20)char r (72)char e (65)char a (61)char d (64)char   (20)char m (6d)char y (79)char   (20)char l (6c)char i (69)char p (70)char s (73)char .
