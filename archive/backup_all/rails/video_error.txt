Hi Russ,Here this the -debug 3 (level) log from serialdd. The first is the command 11\r sent using a telnet session to rails 9902. You can see that there is no "space" (040) in the Read char. Using the actor to send the same command a "space" is inserted after the 11\r. The first command of 11\r from actor produces the correct response of "@" but not the second time as a "space" is now in the first position of video switcher buffer. The actor I used is below the debug log. I could not figure out if it is an actor or serialdd error. Strangely enough the "shell echo 11\r" does not seem to placea "space" after the string print of "11\r". Does it use different code?Bruce(main) [DBug] Server waiting...(main) [DBug] select indicates 1 fds active(main) [DBug] Added client on fd 5(main) [DBug] Server waiting...(main) [DBug] select indicates 1 fds active(main) [DBug] Client connection 5 active.(client_cmd) [DBug] ioctl FIONREAD returns 6(client_cmd) [DBug] Read char 061(client_cmd) [DBug] Read char 061(client_cmd) [DBug] Read char 134(client_cmd) [DBug] Read char 162(client_cmd) [DBug] Read char 015(client_cmd) [DBug] Found terminator character(client_cmd) [DBug] Throw away...(client_cmd) [DBug] Throw away char 012(client_cmd) [DBug] Out of command receive loop(client_cmd) [DBug] Received 4 byte [11\r](client_cmd) [DBug] Exit.
