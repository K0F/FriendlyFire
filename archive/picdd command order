picddThe motor controllors are the only place that the groups are kept. picdd has array which contains both individual and group addresses which their assciated values of vel, accel, pos, kp, kd etc. To send a command to an individual address it must occur AFTER a group address if it belongs to that group. Otherwise the values in the group address will be used instead of the individual values.
